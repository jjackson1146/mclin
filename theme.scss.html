<p class="m-text">I am loving it. I have had it for several weeks now. 1. No heartburn at night, even after eating pizza etc at night. 2. No more snoring. 3. Arms and shoulders feel much better. No more sleeping with my head on my arm and waking up with a sore neck. It's important to have the right pillow. I started with a small, soft pillow and woke up with a sore neck. Switched to a thicker, heavier pillow and it went away. Not great for sleeping on your back. My back can get a little sore where the wedge meets the bed. But the whole point of it for me, is to stop sleeping on my back. I highly recommend it. I definitely won't be returning it.</p>

<p class="m-text">It's expensive, but worth it. The shipment arrived faster than expected. I've had it for 3 days so far. It's very comfortable. I can sleep on my side very comfortably, and for the first time I can also sleep on my back! I've been able to stop using Prevacid (concerned about PPIs!) and switch to Zantac. Also, as an added bonus my sleep apnea is better! I can tell because I am using less water in my CPAP humidifier. Sleeping Great!</p>

<p class="m-text">I was very skeptical but they have a return policy. The price is high but my quality of good sleep is very important. I ended up on my stomach and acid redux was horrible to deal with. I tried everything so I was curious to see if this works. Man does it ever. I've had two and half weeks of the most peaceful restful sleep without any reflux The long pillow, I call my sleep worm now, is divine in comfort. My puppy even sleeps in it with me. I hope and pray it lasts a long time. It works!!!! It would get 5 starts if it wasn't so wide as I need a king size bed now for hubby's pillows to fit well. But works ok with queen.</p>

<p class="m-text">I have a adjustable bed. But hard to stay up with out slipping down. I have tendinitis and bursitis in my shoulders and arms. This seems to help me. Better then laying just flat. Also keeps me sleeping in one area of bed. That, my hubby loves! Love that my arm and shoulder can have a place to be. This is not a small soft pillow. It is firm enough to hold you in place. Love it! I think a even smaller version would soot me. My arms to short to use the way the guy in picture dose. All in all, I won't sleep with out it. Even take with me to people's houses. They chuckle, but it sleep better. Making it on a payment plan, well, not working made it affordable. Thank You MedCline</p>

<p class="m-text">I have been using it for about a month. It is really helping with a number of issues for me: reflux, coughing and sleep apnea. It does take some getting used to but I really like it. For the people that think that they can make this more cheaply and still get the same results, I say good luck with that. There is a lot to this product. The only drawback that I have found is that when you turn, the pillow tends to 'walk' a little bit up towards the head of the bed. If the pillow ends up pressed against the headboard, it squeezes the arm hole out of shape. This has caused my arm to fall asleep. Make sure you leave plenty of room between the top of the pillow and the head board. Especially if you turn side to side a lot.</p>

<p class="m-text">I've been increasingly dealing with occasional heartburn and what I'm pretty sure is hiatal hernia (getting it checked out soon), and saw the MedCline ad on Facebook and made the leap of faith to purchase the Medcline device. I've had it now for maybe a month, and am happy to report that it has worked wonders in doing what's advertised. I also have noticed less shoulder pain due to the ability to drop a shoulder (and elbow) into the opening, whether I sleep as indicated in the photo here or if I bring my forearm back up pointed toward the ceiling. The MedCline also allows me to get a drink of milk in the middle of the night and then lay back down shortly thereafter without feeling like it is sitting there just below my throat. I did not buy the long pillow but can give a very positive review for the MedCline device itself. I do not regret this purchase at all.</p>

<p class="m-text">The Medcline System made a huge difference in my health. I was having lots of GI problems, pain on my left side and indigestion. (I have GERD and a hiatal hernia.) Initially I tried using just a simple wedge from Walmart but I found it very uncomfortable and always ended up sliding down the wedge and sleeping flat when I woke in the morning. I have a Sleep Number bed in the guest bedroom so I used that for a while, with the head raised up, but that too was uncomfortable (unless I slept on my back all night) and again, I would wake sleeping flat after sliding myself down in the bed. Before using the Medcline wedge, I would always sleep with my arm under my body and my shoulders would ache all night. The body pillow is super comfortable and I no longer take prescription medicine either! I have never slept better. In fact, I bought a 2nd set for my vacation home. My only problem now is when I travel.... I wish I could take this with me!</p>

<p class="m-text">I received mine last week . I have reflux and had rotor cuff surgery 9 weeks ago. The other shoulder needs total replacement . It took a couple days to adjust to the angle, but last night I slept so well , I'm looking forward to going to sleep tonight . I don't have pain in my shoulders from sleeping on them now. Before I would flip flop from right to left and back. I also would wake up and my arm would be asleep. The MedCline stopped all this . I'm not an employee or paid to say this , just a very satisfied customer. Yes it is a bit pricey, but having a good night sleep is worth it to me. I'm not wore out from lack of sleep or in pain from sleeping on my shoulders. My two cents ....</p>

<p class="m-text">Going into night three with my pillow. I am extremely impressed. It makes me totally comfortable on both sides when sleeping. It's also very comfortable if you happen to end up on your back. The first night was a bit of an adjustment, but not uncomfortable, just different. Since then I would have to say I wouldn't give it up!! So glad I decided to spend a little extra and suffer a lot less. Worth every cent.</p>
